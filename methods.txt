# About Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory

The Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory (MVCO) Air-Sea Interaction Tower (ASIT) is located at 41.325 N, 70.567 W. See https://mvco.whoi.edu/about/ for more site information. Samples were collected in the vicinity of the tower. Early in the time series, samples were also collected from along- and cross-shore transects nearby.

Starting in 2003, a monthly water sample has been collected at MVCO. The sample is typically collected using a CTD rosette or bucket during a day trip on a coastal vessel such as the R/V Tioga. Starting in February 2018, 4 of the monthly MVCO water samples per year were collected as part of a larger field sampling campaign during Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research project (NES-LTER) quarterly seasonal transect research cruises. 

Transect cruise samples can be differentiated from standard coastal day trips using the event number and event number Niskin parameters because they do not contain 'MVCO', but rather the cruise ID unique to that ship and cruise number. NES-LTER transect cruises always occur on a larger ship than is typical for monthly sample collection, however, the same MVCO time series CTD rosette collection, sampling protocol, and anlaysis methods have been used. 

# CTD Rosette Bottle and Bucket Sampling

Samples were collected from the water column at multiple depths using Niskin bottles on a CTD rosette system. Some samples were collected at the surface with a bucket. In the event_number_niskin field of the data table, MVCO event number is combined with a suffix indicating a bucket sample (_00) or Niskin bottle number (e.g. _01). The depth for bucket samples is 0 m; some MVCO event surface Niskin samples also have depth recorded as 0 m. Samples were collected for whole sea water (multiple depths) and <10 (surface only) size fractions throughout the time series. The <80 size fraction was collected from 2003 to 2008, mainly from surface locations. For each depth sampled, two to three replicate sample bottles were filled from each Niskin, stored in a cooler, and filtered as soon as possible (within 4 hours).  

# Chlorophyll Filtering Protocol

For each sample, a known volume was filtered through a GF/F filter under low vacuum suction (5-10 in. Hg). The <10 and <80 micron size fractions were separated using a filter funnel containing corresponding 10 or 80 micron Nitex mesh screen above the GF/F. Filters were transferred to tissue capsules and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen until being extracted. The two to three replicates filtered from a given Niskin bottle are indicated by a, b, or c in the data table. 

# Chlorophyll a measurement

Filters were removed from liquid nitrogen storage and transferred to glass test tubes. They were then extracted in 5 mL of 90% acetone for 24 hours in a dark refrigerator. A larger extraction volume of 10 or 15 mL was sometimes used when filter visually appeared concentrated when putting in test tube. Test tubes were then vortexed and centrifuged. The solution was measured on a Turner Designs Handheld Aquafluor fluorometer or Turner Designs Picofluorometer Handheld In Vitro fluorometer, acidified with 2-3 drops of 10% hydrochloric acid, and measured again. If the chlorophyll readings were out of the range of the fluorometer, the solution was diluted as needed. A blank and a solid standard were measured at the beginning and end of each batch of samples. The fluorometer was calibrated approximately annually using a serial dilution of stock solution made from commercially available chlorophyll a from spinach (Sigma-Aldrich C5753). The majority of the samples were analyzed in the Sosik lab, with a subset analyzed in the Morrison and Moisan labs. Of these, a subset of samples was analyzed in both the Sosik lab and the collaborating lab, with replicates divided between the labs for intercomparison. 

# Data Cleaning and Package Assembly

We formatted date and time; rounded latitude, longitude, chlorophyll, and phaeopigment; formatted replicate and filter size descriptors; added ship name and R/V Tioga event number when applicable; and ensured that rows were arranged in chronological order. We converted the lab’s internal quality flag to IODE quality flag, described below. Data cleaning and metadata template assembly were performed in R Markdown. Further documentation can be found on GitHub, at https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-chl-mvco.

# Quality Assurance

We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data table were within expected ranges. We checked differences between replicates, visually inspected plots, and performed range checks. The Sosik lab compared chlorophyll a concentration to total chlorophyll a as measured separately via HPLC, where available. We provide a column in the data table to indicate quality using IODE Primary Level flags: 1 good; 2 not evaluated, not available or unknown; 3 questionable/suspect; 4 bad; 9 missing data (see IODE Ocean Data Standards recommendation here: http://dx.doi.org/10.25607/OBP-6). Any sample with a negative phaeopigment value is provided with a flag of 3 (questionable). Samples with a flag of 4 (bad) are provided with chlorophyll and phaeopigment value of NA. A flag of 2 (not evaluated) is applied to samples for which the provider’s thorough evaluation of quality has not yet been completed.
